## Installation

Download the latest release for your system [here](https://github.com/gaheldev/inflator/releases/latest/) and copy it to your `vst` folder.

## Features

Everything has been implemented except the band split so far. \
The plugin should behave very closely to the original, although I didn't null test it as I do not own it.
